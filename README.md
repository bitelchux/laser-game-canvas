This is just a copy of [Lazors](http://pyrosphere.net/lazors/) puzzle game, to learn and improve my knowledge of JavaScript canvas.

I do not own any copyright on the original Lazors.

## About

My purpose is solely to learn canvas while playing with one of my favourite games for smartphone.  
I aim to make this version working on any device that support canvas, independently of the screen size.
